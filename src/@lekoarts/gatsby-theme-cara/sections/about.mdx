## About Me

I have been really into games since childhood and have played many of them. Since then I always wondered how these incredible games are made. And that is why I choose to study about Computers. So, I completed my diploma in Computer Engineering from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. While I was a student of Computer Engineering, I got exposed to the world of Computer Graphics and that is when I decided to get into Game Development. To persue my dream of becoming a Game Developer, I came to canada and took a 3-year Advanced Diploma in Game Development at Algonquin College, Ottawa. At Algonquin, I learned a lot about the different phases of Game Development.
During my years at college, I worked on several games and made several gameplay systems and did lot of UI programming.
